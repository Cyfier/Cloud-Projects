# Multi‑Cloud Security & Network Baseline – Azure AD + AWS SSO with Governance Controls

This project establishes a unified identity, security, and network foundation across Azure and AWS, using Azure AD (Entra ID) as the central identity authority and AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) as the downstream access plane. The goal is to deliver a consistent, least‑privilege, policy‑driven environment that enforces secure access, segmented networking, and governance guardrails across both clouds.
